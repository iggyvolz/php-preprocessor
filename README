Proof-of-concept preprocessor for PHP that allows generating code for different PHP versions.  It uses composer/semver and Composer\InstalledVersions for comparisons.

Needs Composer 2.0 to handle package comparisons

If statements are used like so:
#IF (predicate) (constraint)
...
#ELSE
...
#ENDIF

The predicate is either php, an extension name, or a Composer package name.

The constraint is a Composer semver constraint.

Additionally, the statement:
#ERROR (optional message)
is supported - this will give an error during preprocessing.
